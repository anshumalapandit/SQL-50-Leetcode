# Write your MySQL query statement below
#select Product.product_name, Sales.year, Sales.price from Product, Sales where Product.product_id=Sales.product_id
#but this above query will give us TLE error 
 #Why TLE Error Occurred:
-- 1. Implicit join syntax does not optimize query execution efficiently.
-- 2. Without proper indexing, it can cause a full table scan, increasing execution time.
-- 3. Large datasets make nested loop joins slower, especially without indexes.
select Product.product_name, Sales.year, Sales.price from Product Inner join Sales where Product.product_id=Sales.product_id
# inner join faster hota hai as compared to implicitly join
